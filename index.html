        In the heart of the Amazon lies a magical place unlike any other on Earth: Yasuní. Established in 1979, Parque Nacional Yasuní (PNY) has been designated as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO because of its extraordinary biodiversity.  Recently, it has become increasingly impacted by the complexities of Ecuador’s economic dependency on oil extraction and exportation. In 2007, the government proposed the Yasuní-ITT Initiative that would prevent the exploitation of the oil reserves beneath PNY in exchange for globally-funded compensation for 50% of the value of those reserves ($3.6 billion) over a 13-year period.  Unfortunately, by summer 2013, the government had only received just over $300 million. Consequently, the initiative was officially ended on August 15, 2013. Efforts to spread global awareness of the importance of biodiversity in this region now fall on conservation-oriented communities living and working in the threatened region, including scientists and indigenous Waorani people. Scientists based at the Yasuní Research Station have conducted more than 100 research projects with the aim of promoting sustainable management of Parque Nacional Yasuní.

        Many of these projects have involved partnering with the area’s Waorani people, who have also served as stewards of the forest through long-practiced sustainable use of the forest. The Waorani value the forest above all else, so their relationship with oil companies in the area has become increasingly complex and contentious.  In 1990, the Ecuadorian government created the Waorani Ethnic Reserve, officially recognizing the Waorani people’s authority over 612,560 hectares of forestland, but their ownership rights do not extend to the subsoil where the oil reserves lie. Therefore, it is imperative at this pivotal moment to study the impact of conservation efforts by scientists and Waorani on the preservation of PNY to explain why it might be more advantageous for the long-term health of both Ecuador’s people and economy to save the Amazonian environment instead of subjecting it to oil exploitation.  </p>
