        Little was known about the indigenous peoples living in Yasuní National Park until the middle of the 20th century. When oil exploration and extraction began, it also initiated a fundamental change in the cultures that have traditionally coexisted with the natural resources of the region. During the transition from being nomadic warriors and hunters, the Waorani people living in the north of the region settled near the roads built by the oil company, quickly giving rise to the development of communities and large agricultural plots to support their new form of agrarian life. These warriors accepted an unspoken peace with their Kichwa neighbors. Now they do not fight among themselves but against the winds of change, trying to maintain their traditions and transmit the culture and way of life of their ancestors to the next generation; however, these ancient cultures are beginning to turn towards the influence of modern technology, foreign cultures, and lucrative capitalist opportunities.

        Many of these projects have involved partnering with the area’s Waorani people, who have also served as stewards of the forest through long-practiced sustainable use of the forest. The Waorani value the forest above all else, so their relationship with oil companies in the area has become increasingly complex and contentious.  In 1990, the Ecuadorian government created the Waorani Ethnic Reserve, officially recognizing the Waorani people’s authority over 612,560 hectares of forestland, but their ownership rights do not extend to the subsoil where the oil reserves lie. Therefore, it is imperative at this pivotal moment to study the impact of conservation efforts by scientists and Waorani on the preservation of PNY to explain why it might be more advantageous for the long-term health of both Ecuador’s people and economy to save the Amazonian environment instead of subjecting it to oil exploitation.  </p>
